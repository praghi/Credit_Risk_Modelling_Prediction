# 🏦 Credit Risk Modelling - ML App (End-to-End)
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting on credit. It's designed to help financial institutions make informed lending decisions. The application is built using Python, Scikit-learn/XGBoost, and Streamlit for deployment.

# 💡 Problem Statement
The objective is to classify loan applications as:

Risky (label = 1) – High likelihood of default

Safe (label = 0) – Low likelihood of default

By analyzing applicants’ financial, employment, and demographic data, this model can assist banks and credit providers in mitigating loan default risk.
